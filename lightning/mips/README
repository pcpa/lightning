  The code pass all test cases on contrib/check and lightning tests
on mips32, running on a "Godson2 V0.2" gdium computer. (the push-pop
test is very basic and there is only minimal "dumb" support to pass
the test, use jit_allocai and access it as a vector for "portable"
stack storage access using lightning).

  The logic in core-64.h is not even compiled, and for sure is broken,
as it should be using the n64 abi.

  It should work on all argument combinations for the o32 abi, but
supports only float/double and int/long/pointer arguments, what should
be enough for most usages of lightning.
